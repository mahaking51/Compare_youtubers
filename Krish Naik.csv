I have purchased this course, i Highly recommend not to buy this course.

The quality of course is very bad, and it just like they have accumulated information but no explanation.

"Reducing False Negatives because:
FP-> Customer didn't buy but predicted as bought
FN-> Customer bought but predicted as not bought
We should try to reduce FN in this case because the customer is predicted to buy but our model has predicted that he wouldn't buy, so if we try to reduce it, we can make profits by sending coupons to the more righteous customer and gain profit than to send coupons to the customers who may not buy (FP) and I believe these coupons do not add up to the loss of the company as these coupons just tend to be more of an promotional offer.

"Similar type of question asked to me during interview, that when we are going to predict when will our Machine is going to fail, which error you will reduce..

And the answer is Type-2 error i.e. False Negative...Since in false negative tell us Actual value is true but predicted is false..and if that's the condition then we will probably not send the coupons to our regular customer and we might loose the customer base. SO False negative has to reduce.

Also some of the features, which need to consider are- Customer Age, Profession, Income, Gender, locality, purchase history if any, payment mode, marital status, Frequency of buying product etc.",-0.235576923

"@Krish Naik

I think we should reduce the false negatives , suppose customer is making spend more than 5000$ , but it's predicted as false negative, so there will be chance to lose that costumer..
So the false negatives should be reduced...

If person is predicted false positive , & if we provide discount to that customer. , So there will be more chance he will buy some more items & spend more also there will be chances that he'll spend more next time to get discount related services ,which can turn to increase in relationship with customer..

I think ,in that case we shouldn't lose any customer who're spending more..

Please ,know me what you think ?....
Thank you !!!",-0.227272727

"My answer would be, it depends on customer base like

If we have many customers who are spending more than 5000 then I would go with reducing False Positive

On other hand if we have less customer base who spending less than 5000 in that case these are minority customers and lossing such customers are having high risk in such case I will go with False Negative

In short if My dataset is balanced I will go with reducing False Positive and If my dataset is imbalanced I will go with reducing False Negative",-0.206573427

"2. Say you are standing at the bottom of a staircase with a a dice. With each throw of the dice, you either
move down one step (if you get a 1 or 2 on the dice) or move up one step (if you get a 3, 4 or 5 on the
dice). If you throw a 6 on the dice, you throw the dice again and move up the staircase by the number you
get on that second throw. Note if you are on the base of the staircase, you cannot move down! What is the
probability that you will reach more than 60 steps after 250 throws of the dice.
Change the code so that you have a function that takes as parameter, the number of throws. Add a new
parameter to the function that takes a probability distribution over all outcomes from a dice throw. For
example (0.2,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1) would suggest that the probability of getting a 1 is 0.2, 2 is 0.3 etc. How

"Except for the Ensemble Learning algorithms RF, XGboost, Gradient Boost, Ada Boost other algorithms may get affected by the Imbalanced dataset.  

why only these not effected
1. Ensemble Learning is of creating N number of Week models to make strong learners in RF. 
 2. XGBoost is a combination of Bagging and boosting, it takes the weighted average of the many weak models and by focusing on weak predictions and iterating through the next models it reduces the error.


3. same with gradient boost it starts with a weak prediction as average and builds decision trees by adding learning rate times the outcome of the residual tree to the initial prediction and process repeated.
4. Ada boost gives more weight to the incorrectly classified samples in creating further stumps.

"Hi Below is my answer - 

 There is no rule of thumb to find out how many hidden layers you need. In many cases, one hidden layer works well, but in order to justify this for a specific problem, you have to apply a heuristic method such as cross-validation. Using cross-validation you divide your data into two parts namely training set and validation set (also called test set).

But still, you should start with the simplest ANN architecture, that is a 3-layer network. As for the number of hidden layer units, try to use the less possible (start with 5, for instance), and allow for more if the network is unable to learn the problem. If the problem requires very complicated nonlinear separations, it may be necessary that you introduce a 2nd hidden layer, but you need to try first with just 1 hidden layer.

 Determining the Number of Hidden Layers - 

0 - Only capable of representing linear separable functions or decisions.

 1 - Can approximate any function that contains a continuous mapping
from one finite space to another.

 2 - Can represent an arbitrary decision boundary to arbitrary accuracy
with rational activation functions and can approximate any smooth
mapping to any accuracy.

There are many rule-of-thumb methods for determining the correct number of neurons to use in the hidden layers, such as the following:

The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.
The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer.
The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.
These three rules provide a starting point for you to consider. Ultimately, the selection of an architecture for your neural network will come down to trial and error. There is a concept call “Pruning a Neural Network”, it has explained in detail the same.",-0.045402299

"Classification Algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Linear SVM (kernel= 'linear') which try to find an optimal hyperplane are generally prone to imbalanced dataset.  The reason behind this is these linear classifiers are actually to solve their respective optimization problems in presence of a tradeoff, which is: Greater Generalization Power Vs Minimal Classification Error. Hence if the dataset itself is imbalanced, it will be only solving the optimization problem for the points of the majority class, given we haven't done any hyper-paramter tuning. Now for some aggressive hyper-parameter tuning, we get these classifiers to perform okayish for imbalanced dataset (tuning for minimising error over maximising generalization power), but then we will be sacrificing the Generalization Power for unseen datasets, which isn't desirable, also hyper-parameter tuning won't work for severely imbalanced datasets.

Now, for Similarity based algos such as KNN are also prone to imbalanced datasets, as they employ a majority voting at the end to make their classification decision.

Kernel SVM shouldn't be prone to imbalanced dataset, because it finds suitable optimal support vectors using the kernel itself, that is if the dataset is imbalanced, then their will be less number of support vectors for the minority class. (Please do correct if I am wrong on this one)

Naive Bayes isn't affected by the imbalanced as it calulates the likelihood of each (seen) features during runtime.

Tree based algorithms such as Decision Tress and Random Forest should also not be affected by imbalanced datasets, because they divide the given feature space into axis parallel hyperplanes. (Also, they try to maximise the information gain)

Also, I think that MLP based algos would overfit the training dataset if it is imbalanced, hence making them immune to imbalanced datasets. This is a guess, please correct if it's wrong.

I am certain that some of which I have said maybe rubbish, please correct if it really is! Great series Krish Sir!",-0.013265306

We as Engineers from tier 3 colleges look for hope .....
Which u have bombarded and now I feel without you we could not have that start !!
Thanks, Krish sir for the motivation

Abhishek sir is a reason to grow more and high ..higherr
When I watch Abhishek sir's vlogs/videos I feel like watching BBC news ...even though u know english we cant have fluency, vocabulary like them but try harderr u can imitate them and its a hope....

"For the people who are trying to implement the train_test_split and getting error. 
The reason for this is when you apply lemmatize some sentences in the corpus are turned to blanks.

Try running the below code after lemmatizer code:
[[i,j,k] for i,j,k in zip(list(map(len,corpus)),corpus, messages['message']) if i<1]

You will see that around 8 sentences are turned into blanks and their length is zero. The reason they turn blank is that all the words in the sentences below are in stopwords list.

[[0, '', 'What you doing?how are you?'],
 [0, '', 'Where @'],
 [0, '', '645'],
 [0, '', 'Can a not?'],
 [0, '', ':) '],
 [0, '', 'What you doing?how are you?'],
 [0, '', ':( but your not here....'],
 [0, '', ':-) :-)']]

Because of this reason, 'simple_preprocess' ignores these rows in the corpus and the final dimensions of X and y do not match i.e 5564(X) vs 5572(y). Therefore train_test_split also throws an error.

To fix this, recalculate y by removing the messages dataframe rows corresponding to the above blank sentences as follows:

y = messages[list(map(lambda x: len(x)>0 ,corpus))]
y=pd.get_dummies(y['label'])
y=y.iloc[:,1].values

"While finding percentile we used to use this formula
if r = np is integer , then use r
if r = np is not an integer, then use [r+1] ,  and select the integer part

say u have to find 25 percentile  and u have say 10 observations so
arrange the n obsn in ascending order .
n = 10 , p = 25/100 = 0.25
so r = np = 2.5  is not an integer,  so we take [2.5+1] = [3.5]

Can you make a Collab with @Tanay Pratap ?,0
Yes being a data scientist I can say it's definitely a hype. 😂,0
I would say Don't find a way to insert AI into everything. Find the 'Question that needs to be answered' then ask 'Can it be answered through AI',0
Lets say it is not overrated...then why Fortune 500 companies hire only Ms/PhD people for their ai research projects and not somebody who have transitioned their career recently? Why companies like Amazon/Google/Facebook ignores the ml projects stated on a freshers resume? I think because they know it is hype and overrated among freshers as everyone can do projects by simply using scikit.,0

Here’s a report Published recently by Anaconda. This will clarify the doubt.

1.Data science is hype 2. Its not technology are two separate questions.,0
"Yes its a hype. Why? 
1. See the Job Descriptions. They are so vague that no one knows what actually a data science is.
2. There will be many jobs in future. Yes. But then you need prior experience. If you don't have prior experience, your resume will be thrown in the dustbin.",0

AI is the future and anything associated with AI is not a hype,0

"We have AI ohhhhhh, underneath: logistic regression and linear regression",0

As soon as completion of Engineering many opt for java testing & automation including civil guys, some goes for MBA,Mtech. rest do a mediocre jobs.

"For the people who are trying to implement the train_test_split and getting error. 
The reason for this is when you apply lemmatize some sentences in the corpus are turned to blanks.

Try running the below code after lemmatizer code:
[[i,j,k] for i,j,k in zip(list(map(len,corpus)),corpus, messages['message']) if i<1]

You will see that around 8 sentences are turned into blanks and their length is zero. The reason they turn blank is that all the words in the sentences below are in stopwords list.

[[0, '', 'What you doing?how are you?'],
 [0, '', 'Where @'],
 [0, '', '645'],
 [0, '', 'Can a not?'],
 [0, '', ':) '],
 [0, '', 'What you doing?how are you?'],
 [0, '', ':( but your not here....'],
 [0, '', ':-) :-)']]

Because of this reason, 'simple_preprocess' ignores these rows in the corpus and the final dimensions of X and y do not match i.e 5564(X) vs 5572(y). Therefore train_test_split also throws an error.

To fix this, recalculate y by removing the messages dataframe rows corresponding to the above blank sentences as follows:

y = messages[list(map(lambda x: len(x)>0 ,corpus))]
y=pd.get_dummies(y['label'])
y=y.iloc[:,1].values

y.shape",0

"The main problem with Batch Gradient Descent is the fact that it uses the whole
training set to compute the gradients at every step, which makes it very slow when
the training set is large. At the opposite extreme, Stochastic Gradient Descent just
picks a random instance in the training set at every step and computes the gradients
based only on that single instance. Obviously this makes the algorithm much faster
since it has very little data to manipulate at every iteration. It also makes it possible to
train on huge training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each
iteration (SGD can be implemented as an out-of-core algorithm.)
On the other hand, due to its stochastic (i.e., random) nature, this algorithm is much
less regular than Batch Gradient Descent: instead of gently decreasing until it reaches
the minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on aver‐
age. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will
continue to bounce around, never settling down . So once the algo‐
rithm stops, the final parameter values are good, but not optimal.",0.014317043

"I'm new to Coding, let alone Data Science. Normally people do the hard work in learning concepts and doing some projects before applying for Internships or Jobs. But I got a chance from my college to work as a Data Scientist & Research for an EdTech Company without any prior experience of ML, DL, CV & NLP. I got the responsibility of building  a computational framework to rank audio video recorded job interviews based on various behavioral related competencies and Python related technical skills. Online Interview is more relevant than ever in the Corona Virus Pandemic. Basis this motivation, I've completed 85% of the job till now  in just 3 months by seeing various resources on the internet. I now believe when you actually start getting your hands dirty and have a real motivation behind it, things fall in place.

"Ohh No I feel bad for you @krish. Rtx 3070 and 3080 Look OOF in terms of performance especially for AI,Though ur Titan RTX is a beast in itself with the high VRam, I read an article somewhere back that the Gen2 tensor cores even in the Turing chips are 70% idle due to extremely fast matrix compute and they were just waiting for the memory to fetch data, Which is why i believe they came up with the newer GDDR6X which is way faster to make sure they utilize those tensor cores better, That also explains the fewer tensor cores on the 3070 as compared to the 2070 . I myself as a learner will be building the base 3070 build next month. I have read 8GB Ram is ok for beginners and learners. G0DSP33D",0.021363636

I am a BSc graduate passed in 2004 and working as a game designer.  I am 37 years of age and was hoping to shift my career from designing to data science.
I have seen the topics needed to be learned for a data scientist job and am confident that I can learn them in due time even though I am starting from scratch.

1. Data Science (1) with Machine Learning (2) & Neural Networks (3) - three subdivisions of AI applied in 4 types of data (Numeric, Text, Image & Audio/Video) currently (till now). 
This means, it is applied in all fields - Every Damn company needs it badly!!!
You can learn all 3 subdivisions (or) 1 & apply it in different data application types you like/ company use.
2. Growth in this field is directly proportional to growth in Data & Processors! more processing. Which will damn sure was growing, now growing & will grow.
3. Future is the ERA of these things - AI, Cloud, Robotics, Bitcoin, Blockchain, AR & VR.

"About Bias correction in Adam, Just wanted to write about the need for it, So when we have B1 and B2 (Beta) , for the first iteration Both Momentum parameter and learning rate parameter will be zero so Sdw(1) will end up being very small and since Sdw will be in the denominator while updating the new weight w1, this will give a really huge change for the initial iterations and in the paper it has been mentioned that due to this bias of having zero (For the first iteration), the loss might not reduce over time so, we the authors proposed a bias correction, where we do a weighted average instead of a simple moving average
 
Sdw(t)corrected = Sdw(t)/1-(B2^t) where t is the number of iterations so if you notice, for the first few iterations the value of bias corrected Sdw(t) is different from Sdw(t) but as t increases Sdw(t)corrected is equal to Sdw(t) as the denominator becomes 1, thus this correction removes the bias created by using Vdw(0)=0 and Sdw(0)=0",0.047027972

"Q1: How do you decide how many hidden layers?
         Ans:   Well if the data is linearly separable then you don't need any hidden layers at all. 
If data is less complex and is having fewer dimensions or features then neural networks with 1 to 2 hidden layers would work.
If data is having large dimensions or features then to get an optimum solution, 3 to 5 hidden layers can be used. 
        Note:   It should be kept in mind that increasing hidden layers would also increase the complexity of the model and choosing hidden layers such as 8, 9, or in two digits may sometimes lead to overfitting.

"1st distribution: Pareto Distribution (power law probability distribution, talks about 80-20 rule i.e. 80% of outcomes are result of 20% causes)


Convert pareto distribution to normal distribution: using box cox transformation (it converts to nearly normal distribution, formula is: 
x_new = log(x_old) if lambda = 0
x_new = (x_old**lambda - 1)/lambda otherwise)


Check if distribution is normal gaussian distribution or not: Draw QQ plots (Quantile-Quantile plot) where we draw actual quantiles for data and theoretical quantiles and then look at deviation.


What is standard normal distribution?
Normal distribution with mean 0 and std 1


Plot A: Right Skewed
mean > median > mode
Plot B: Left Skewed
mode > median > mean

Difference between fit_transform and transform
fit_transform do two operations on input data in one go which are fit the transformer as per the calculations on input data and then apply those calculations to input data
transform: will only apply calculations on input data as per transformer.

When we use fit_predict and what is it?
fit_predict fits the model as per input data and later on make a prediction as well using trained model. We generally use it in clustering algorithms like DBSCAN where we can only do fit_predict or fit. Predict is not possible there.


What is difference between standardization and normalization?
1. Normalization is basically min max scaling
2. Values belong to [0,1] or [-1,1]
3. Affected by outliers
4. Useful when we don't know about distribution 

1. Standardization converts data in a manner that mean of transformed data is 0 and std=1
2. No bound on values
3. Not much affected by outliers
4. Useful when data distribution is normal gaussian distribution.

"Hard Skills of Data Science => programming skill + stats + math + algorithms + data visualization + experience on cloud service (AWS / Azure / GCP) + domain expertise. In 2012, Harvard published the ""sexiest job of the 21st century"" article that popularized the data scientist term. 9 years later, employees with this killer combination of skills are so rare that they are still referred to as unicorns. Most companies feel that the skill combinations overlap greatly in CS / Signal Processing / Math / Stats / Physics PhDs and they are partially right. It is quite easy to get a CS / SP / Math / Stats / Physics Ph.D. and get them up to speed on AWS + Tableau  / Azure + Qlikview or whatever the company uses in a few months. For others, it can be a steep learning curve as the typical Indian B.Tech degree syllabus in Mechanical, Civil, Chemical, Architecture has little in common with the required Data Science Hard Skills. The past few years have seen a spurt in scientific research and new journals focusing on the mathematics of data science. We can safely say that data science is no hype. Looking at the 2020 articles in SIAM's journal of Mathematics of Data Science (https://epubs.siam.org/toc/sjmdaq/2/1), I see topics like Graph Theory, Non-convex optimization, stochastic processes, persistent homology. Where are these topics ever covered in B.Tech syllabus of mechanical / civil / chemical / architecture?",0.069136518

"Data science is not a hype. There are lot of jobs available but a sad truth about Indian market today is decent  companies who are transitioning into AI are struggling to create value for their stakeholders. One primary reason being lack of understanding in management  about the subject. They overestimate the capability of AI and fail to recognise it's limitations. Also there is lack of experienced data scientists who can guide the young talents in development. And hence due to this there are constant developments, they are not able to freeze the product and the company struggles to generate stable revenue. So these are some of the struggles in data science I've seen as ML engineer along with some others, but this is likely to get sorted out in a few years when there's more deeper understanding of subject.",0.069871795

Thanks for the very good example .
I just want to reiterate the  above example  with small changes.
Valid Model -> A student whose performs well in his internal exams as well as his final exam IIT because he understood the concepts very  well so he can 
imagine if the question asked indirectly.
Overfitted model -> A student who performs very well in internal exams but he fails to perform best in the  final exam IIT because he prepared  internal exams  based on previous questions  that were asked in the internal test  and did not understood the concepts very well.
Underfitted Model -> A person does not perform well in the internal exams  so he cannot perform well as in Final exam like IIT.
Data Leakage :-> A person trying to attempt a exam for which he already knows question before  the exam. and He cannot crack the other competitive exams .",0.070238095

UTF8 is used for electronic communication, like the data we process we convert this alpha numeric data into machine language using UTF8 encoding .. and we all know at granular level the machine language is in 0s and 1s, so we need some sort of encoding to convert the incoming English language alphabets into machine language for a machine to process the data ...

but when the incoming language has some characters which are not defined in English language then machine will not able to convert it into 0s and 1s cos for it its a foreign word/character not listed in given reference directory which is UTF8 in this case, so we need to provide appropriate reference so in case of incoming data has Japanese character then you can use JIS encoding, in case of incoming data has Latin characters then latin-1 etc ...",0.080357143

how do you know how many hidden layers and how many nodes in each hidden layer . Why did you choose in this example 2 hidden layers and 7 and 6 nodes for each layer ?

Small correction bro. Don't expect an already existing data science team in every company. I have changed 5 companies as a data scientist and data analyst positions and none of them has a pre-existing team. I was doing solo performance in all of those companies. Mostly you will find one guy extra working in the same project.,0.083333333

To make my model more interactive and useful, like I don't want to show companies my (.py file), so to solve that problem maybe I should go for MLops(devops + ml) or
2.read more research papers, learn new and advance algo and techniques which no books or course teaches u, start doing competition and maybe go for writing a research paper which would be very helpful for my  ms admission in good college.

"@Krish Naik: There are multiple aspects to this question. You did a good job but I would like to add a few points to this. 
First and foremost - ""it's very important to understand what they mean by hype?"" Are they saying data science and related field is not going to last or it's all talk but no action? OR  do they mean it's a reality but it's been hyped by the companies and educational institutes?

For the people who claim the first part - as you also mentioned, they actually don't have a clear understanding of the Data Science field. Under this comes the first category, who are in majority, they don't have a clue what Data Science is and how does it work. For them, it's a magic wand that works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. And IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO REJECT WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO CHANGE. I have experience with some senior management, not in my current company, who thought bots logic is just 'IF and ELSE rules'. So, why do we need an NLP or data, science expert? HE was still better as he had some idea of bots (wrong or right that's a different story). I pity and kinda get pissed on those, who have no clue but they just heard someone else say so they are also repeating the same. Then there is another category, who have half baked information and they believe what they know is the ultimate truth. 

The LAST CATEGORY THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THIS DIRECTLY LINKS TO THE THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION. These are the people who see what the majority of data scientists (that they know) are doing in their jobs. AND WHEN I SAY DATA SCIENTISTS THEN THAT MEANS SOMEONE WITH THE ""DESIGNATION OF DATA SCIENTIST"".  Yes, in most of the companies the data scientist label is used very broadly and vaguely and that creates more confusion. For example, if I don't know about data science but I see data scientists just doing some standard old dashboards in some new tech - I would think Data Science is hype; we have been doing this under, let's say data warehousing or ETL, etc., for so long. AND THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY WRONG.

I feel this has created a big- big confusion and wrong perception. I had a discussion with a director-level person who thinks (still he does) it's old wine in a new bottle. I feel for most of the part - HR and Companies are responsible for this. Because it's a buzz word nowadays, every company is putting ""data Science"" opening. 
The first category is the companies who are hiring just to do what others are doing - I personally know companies that have no use cases but they are hiring data scientists. What do you think will happen to those hired data scientists? They will wait for projects, then slowly to have a better utilization they will be given some random work which has something to do with 'analytics', and they will continue like this for quite some time. 
The second category is of those who are clear from starting for what they are hiring is not exactly is a data science job but they will give designation. And many people will apply because it's THE HOT JOB in the market! The same fate for these people too.
 
So, people who see them and people who went through this - will have a very different perception of data science. 

Last but not the least, recently there has been so much surge in the courses for Data science just because it's the current buzz word and everyone wants to learn this. But believe me, 70-80% of these courses are given by people who themselves don't have a clear understanding and many times they don't even have practical knowledge of the subject itself. Without naming anyone, I know someone who just after doing a course together with me started his own coaching for data science!!! You get a certificate and build some luring model and do good digital marketing and bang - you can easily get a handful of the students! But honestly, what will be the preparation level of these students? When they go for an interview - what will happen? Because of this, it's becoming very difficult even for recruiters - Everyone is now mentioning EXPERT IN ML, NLP, CV, DL etc., and most of the time it's all air no matter!  To weed out these people some times HR go overboard and put some unrealistic requirement for a job - honestly, they are not that much experienced (most of them)  in Data Science or new tech. So they mix it up - recently I was reading a job description that required 8 years of experience in NLP, DL, and CV. I am not saying it's not possible but it sounded like they are looking for someone with the total experience of the same experience in these areas. On further investigation, I found out - first the person has to go back and check with the hiring manager :) and then he said, they are looking for 8 years but even 3-4 years will do! 

So, there are many aspects that are creating this image of Data Science is hype! Yes, it's hype if you are talking with respect to what most of the companies are hiring for and making a hired data scientists do! But if you are talking the actual Data Science field in itself - then NO WAY it's a hype -  it's going flourish only, NOT going to die :) 
You were mentioning regarding the Gartner, I agree with you - I work with Gartner, Forrester (another leader in this area) closely to get all the latest reports, so even in 2020 end reports what they are projecting for 2021 is RPA and AI is going to be the top tech. I will not go into the details of that but if you see last 1 year's top 10 startups RPA and AI startups are the majority. Just to clarify - old fashion automation is now getting a little stale, now RPA is mixed with AI, few call it Cognitive RPA (We love to coin fancy terms!). 

My 2 cents to aspirants- spend some time to gain practical experience and don't rush for an interview with half-baked concepts. And when interviewing with a company be clear and firm on your job expectations. Many times, freshers or career switcher agrees for anything as long as they are getting the data scientists tag! Believe me, that's going to come back and bite you. Maybe you will even start hating the field and will move to the other field. Go for companies who actually are into AI/Data Science/RPA etc. And I read many freshers or people with no experience in data science asking how to get the job if everyone asks for 3-4 years. Krish has shared in one of the videos I guess. I would just suggest - don't always target for data scientists job, it's very rare you will be given that designation without proposer experience or unless you showcase some good projects - if you're already working try to transition within the company - that's much easier. or target for associate DS or maybe even Analyst (depending upon the company the JD varies).",0.097576897

"I have strong understanding of ml field and I can clearly say that data science don't have future.
Reasons: it's new tech and obviously it's the future specially ai, but if you would learn ai then you would notice that there is a specific way of doing everything in ai and if you are doing something else then it basically counts as research and you need to be that good to be counted in that.
Now there will be a software library of everything else which data scientists are doing and then it would be merged with software industry. Only few companies are actually leveraging the real ml potential and others are just doing basic stuffs in ai. 
In my opinion, in future both the fields will get merged. It's distict only till the time when new researches are going on into ml and when it would develop a base then it would be common and there would be so many libraries around which anybody would be able to use.",0.103717851

1. The Internship experience certificate will be o how many months?? How do you calculate the number of months as experience in the internship? 
2. I already completed the basic python and numpy, pandas and Matplotlib. Should I start the iNeuron open internship and learn the machine learning and statistics in parallel or I should complete those first and then start the internship??",0.10625

Omg I can't even think of a better time to get this video on my timeline. So here is my experience - i work as an inside sales executive in the SAAS field and cracked a job as a Java developer in an MNC but the company declared my candidature as null and void since I was not able to get green exit from my current employer due to 90 days notice period. I was so demotivated but seeing this video has given me the idea how to proceed further. PS - my current employer retained and hopefully I might also get an appraisal.🙂,0.1125

"for p value and test statistic I have thing to add.

P value is like the are in the distribution and test statistic is the value on the x axis

so if p value< significance value  it means are falls under significance region so you reject null hypothesis(H0) and similarly 

if test statistic >  critical value it means on x axis the value lies in the significance region so you again reject (H0).

Critical value is your boundary and Significance is your area. So this is the underlying intuition.

"Hello Krish, everything in the video is very well explained, but I didn't understand why do we need bais correction for the Adam formula and why it uses b1 and b2, which depend on the timestamp t? b1 and b2 seemed to be constant values through out your explanations, so it doesn't make sense to me why would they depend on time in that formual... But just in case, b1(t) and b2(t) equal to b1 and b2, then the end formual would look like: vdw = vdw * (b1/(1-b1)) + dl/dw. Where in case of b1 = 0.95, we would get: vdw = vdw * 19 + dl/dw, so it looks like a scaled version of the original fromula, where all variables are given an additional weight.

"Failure-This Happens many times when we are into a begining of a new field.This Failure frustated me many times, but it keeps on motivating me when i heard story of sucessfull people especially You two Krish Naik and Abhishek Thakur , so i thought these 
failures are common to every one and I keep motivating myself.So about book I know abhishek thakur sir kept in his mind like what people generally will commit mistake in the problem solving or approching (because while he's learning he may be faced) so i think abhishek sir will come up with good approch for all these problems which is a big contribution to data science community.Finally Thanks for everything Krish Sir you are my true mentor.

Seems like FN is more important as original customers are getting lost, if not given benefits.

"I also believe AI/DataScience/ML everything is hype. AIl these techniques can help a company to increase its end efficiency only, AI can not replace soft skills, management skills, and brains needed to run the main business functions like- Sales, Operations, Supply chain, Marketing, Finance. If a recession hits then the data science department of a company will be the most affected one. Companies are investing in data science just because of the projections being made by companies like Gartner and other research and advisory companies. If after sometime companies suspect that data science is not adding value to their bottom line then they will stop investing in this area. Let's see what will happen 5 years down the line.",0.133333333

3. yes for now mac does not support some app. for machine learning but in near future it will be solved by apple. and still there are other ways to use these applications or libraries. 
4. and at least but not last i am very impressed by its bettery which gives you 18hrs of video play back. and i found almost all windows laptop providing a very less bettery back up. 
after purchasing macbook even after 10 years it looks new and perform good. and bettery reduces only 2-3 hr means you will have 15-16hrs bettery back up even after 10years still higher than windows.

•	Business travelers are willing to pay a higher price for a premium product and/or for flights at a more convenient time 
•	Leisure travelers are more price-sensitive, that is to say, less willing to pay and willing to modify their date for a lower price


•	Airlines consider a number of variables when setting ticket prices including their costs, a ceiling price for each market segment, competitors’ prices, economic conditions, and customer behavior.

"When considering privacy of the data, we must first find out the features that may be the cause for privacy leakage. It might be features like age, country or gender etc. The simplest method will be to remove these features, but then these features might contribute to a better model building and removing them completely is not a really good idea. 
We can maybe use encoding techniques like SMPC or homomorphic techniques. A very simple implementation of these techniques can be done using tf-encrypted which is very much similar to using tensorflow. But this might seem a bit complicated and I am a bit unsure if it will yield better results during model building. 
So another method that we can do is create synthetic data or artificially generated data. But this method has some drawbacks too.
So the method that we follow to preserve the privacy of the data depends on the use case and how important the features are during model building.",0.138888889
"When considering privacy of the data, we must first find out the features that may be the cause for privacy leakage. It might be features like age, country or gender etc. The simplest method will be to remove these features, but then these features might contribute to a better model building and removing them completely is not a really good idea. 
We can maybe use encoding techniques like SMPC or homomorphic techniques. A very simple implementation of these techniques can be done using tf-encrypted which is very much similar to using tensorflow. But this might seem a bit complicated and I am a bit unsure if it will yield better results during model building.

I am your consistent follower.
I am currently working for a service-based organization.
We are doing outsourced full Fletch development/testing except marketing for the XXXXX technologies product PPPP.

I am just 6 months old here, and I haven't got satisfactory answers to my queries from my manager.

Below are my doubts:
1. Why XXXX technology gives outsourcing development to service-based YYYY.--my genetic question would be 
what are the specific reasons a product-based organization outsourced their product?
2. what are the pros and cons for product-based and for service-based as well in such scenarios.
3. what are the chances that again outsourcing goes to some other service-based company - in some cases product outsourcing goes here and there??
4. Is there a chance that XXXX technologies rethink again do the development on its own after some years
5. what about job security/Growth in such cases if a product goes here and there?? -- does it affect decrement in the salary ??

I would appreciate the answers.",0.14

"ek number session ... in easy terms ... BIAS is the inability of ML algorithm to capture the 100 percent or exact relationship. To understand bias one must think why do we need a ML in first place. In mathematics or physics we have absolute relationship or formula between dependent and independent variables like s=ut+1/2 at2 (std 7 Physics) or SI = P*R*T  so for computing cases like we have absolute formula we don't need any ML algo. ML try to do the same i.e. estimate a formula, let say I want to calculate the purchasing power (P) so I train a model with different variables like income,age, family income and m model fetches a formula  P = wo+ b1*income+b2*age + b3* family income..... So this formula is not absolute or universal as its derived by a specific ML algo for specific data but let say by miracle we derive a formula that exactly calculates the purchasing power with 100 percent accuracy so for that model bias is 0 as the model accurately captures the relationship..... Variance ---- Talking about variance, in short way the difference in fits between data set is called variance , imagine we used that same miracle formula in test data and data fits 100 percent as in we get 100 percent accuracy(for different test set) then we can say that the variance is 0 which means the ML formula is perfect or let say when use the same miracle formula in test set we get 50% accuracy which means the bias was low but variance is high as formula didnt work well with unseen (test) data... SO in an imaginary world if bias is 0 and variance is also 0 then my friend you have discovered a formula not an estimation ....

You both are blessing to data science community. Getting your new book , will help me understand the actual challenges in data acquisition and hoping to solve data that is actually dirty in real world scenario and how to go about it in building  the model.I am looking forward to apply the techniques you have learnt in your data science journey by reading the book and then figuring out which technique suits the most in my problem statement. I will be honoured if i can get a free ecopy at

"I wanna be the first one to complete this tutorial. There you go guys I am not up for 6-7 hours straight. Will make an update by 7 pm today evening on whether I completed this tutorial or not. Plus will add time stamps!!!! 

 LET'S GOOOOOOOO 

Edit :- Just completed the course and it is 6.23 pm I made it!!! The course is pretty decent for beginners in Deep Learning. I got 75% of the course I would say because I have a background in Machine Learning. It would have been better if activation functions were explained more deeply. Rest of it was good. I would revise it again ( Not at 2x speed this time ) and will add time stamps as I am very tired nowwwwww 

adios amigos. Thanks Krish <3",0.147222222

Actually I have attend interview, they ask me about Data science related question, I answered them. But they asked 3  coding questions related competitive programming. I'm not able to solve 2  out 3 . 
But They took one coding test related to data scrapping & I solved that question but they rejected me ? 
Remaining interview was good. 
My question to you is 
does competitive programming required for data science roles ?
if yes what are the question we have to prepare ?
Coding Questions asked in interview:
1. If a & b is input are remains  same how we can increase  output every time by 2 ? - Solved but they said it wrong approach 
2. They give me n = 568, write a code for finding next ramanujan number after the n? - Not able to solve
3. They gave me a json file, asked about unique keys , How many values has type list? -  Solved 
& Final question for data scrapping 
They provided a website & told me to extract specific amount of data . -  This one is I solved correctly  
experience. Can you suggest more on this",0.148214286

"Hi Krish,
Is the below steps was correct for regression problem. 
1. In linear Regression Model first we will do EDA, Feature Engineering, Data Pre-processing and will split data into Train and Test.
2. Creating model using Linear Regression and evaluate the model like finding Loss and R2 Square.
3. If we could see more Loss then we have to do optimization using gradient decent and stochastic gradient decent for minimizing the Loss
4. Finally we have to check Bias and Variance trade-off if model getting overfitting then use L1 regularisation for preventing overfitting and L2 regularisation for preventing overfitting and feature selection as well.
Thanks,",0.156666667

"Thanks for the video! Amazing explanations! I have a question, here the datasets both have only one column and the time as index. If I have only one dataframe with time as index, milk and passengers as columns, is it multivariate prediction? I mean, are the passenger values being influenced by the milk values or vice versa?",0.1625

"To be  honest I believe seeing the obsession towards brand tags , these companies just put forth a fancy CTC which in reality differs a lot. Most ppl don't differentiate b/w ctc and lpa, as such companies just include huge  ESOPS/RSU's which actually are paid in the latter years but included in the initial CTC. Amazon includes 12 lpa worth ESOPS in it's compensation for freshers 80% of which r paid in the 3rd nd 4th years.Even a portion of the joining bonus is paid in 2nd year",0.1625

"I'd like to improve my python's application performance, by passing a Multiprocessing pipe when instantiating the PyQt widget.   

One way I thought of doing is to create a custom class that extends both a pyqt widget and multiprocessing.

For example this inherits from ONLY Qt,
class MainWindowReceiver(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
super(MainWindowReceiver, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

And can be instantiated without passing any argument:
main = MainWindowReceiver()
main.show()

However, if I create a class that inherits from both PyQt AND multiprocessing,
class MainWindowReceiver(QtWidgets.QMainWindow ,  mp.Process):
super(Process, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

then NONE of these work:
out_pipe = mp.Pipe()
p1 = MainWindowReceiver(out_pipe) #doesn't work
p1 = MainWindowReceiver(pipe=out_pipe) #doesn't work
p1 = MainWindowReceiver(,pipe=out_pipe) #doesn't work
p1.show()

1) What does the syntax look like to construct a class that inherits from both PyQt & multiprocessing, such that instantiation its object, only requires the pipe argument?  

2) Is there a way to pass a pipe to a PyQt Widget WITHOUT creating a multiple-inherited class?",0.166666667

And what people don't see is that Krish has set up a store selling his t-shirts and products all the while trying to convince people that he can prepare them for a data science job. Sorry, this is not how a data scientist can be successful.",0.17

"Appreciate the work BUT this resume will NOT work in many of the companies. Most of the companies look for STAR format.

"Its good to see that you're celebrating Indian festivals like Diwali with puja and such fanfare. Otherwise, I've even worked in companies like HPE (now DXC) where foreign festivals like Haloween, Martyrs's Day, Easter and Christmas (most of which were unheard of by Indians like me) were celebrated more than any of the grand Indian festivals like Holi & Diwali. Even all the Muslim employees working in the company were given off on all of the Eid and Muharram days, shifts adjusted to suit their Ramzan timings, but for Hindu employees like me, no gifts, bonus or leave on any of the major Hindu festivals like Diwali & Holi or even New Year, with the comp off adjusted for later. I personally have come to office and worked even on Diwali night and New Year night while the rest of the world celebrated outside. They didn't know how to treat their good and loyal Indian employees fairly and thats why, that company has ceased to exist, broken down into several parts and the company that used to pride itself on being one of the big MNCs of the world had to later join hands with a small time Indian company, CSC, just in order to survive and be relevant after the parent company HP spat them out from their group like a person spits out a piece of chewing gum.",0.17967803

"Totally agree with Krish. When people tell me these things my simple question to them is - ""Do you want to keep crying over what you didn't or don't have OR you want to make effort to make your future better?"" It's that simple! Whatever problem was there genuine or your excuse but it had already happened. Now, what options you have? We don't have a time machine yet - so can't go back and change things. So, the only feasible option is to do things now that will make your future better otherwise again 2 -5 years down the lane you will be crying if I had done this at that time things would have been different. This is applicable to any situation.
Yes, being in tier-1 college does help. I prefer the marathon analogy in this respect. Life is not a 100 meters race but a marathon. Being from a tier-1 college can give you, maybe, 50 meters ahead start. IF you are looking for short-term accomplishments such as the first job CTC then in most cases yes the one from tier-1 has an advantage (though not always - there are students who have done great wonders even without a proper college education).  But in long term, you have ample opportunities to overtake him/her. Though I am not a big fan of such competition - just giving an example as most people are used to compare themselves with the others. Instead of this, it will be better if we have our own goal defined be it money wise or profile wise (just talking with respect to jobs, not life in general). And there is no shame in having a money-oriented goals. I see many students/people giving philosophical answers because in Indian society we have been trained this way to be money-oriented is bad! ( in the majority of the middle class - not directly but indirectly). Anyway coming back to the original topic - being from a tier-3 college may put you 50 meters behind - so you need to put an extra effort and work hard to cover this gap. I have seen lots of students and have lots of friends from tier-1,2,3 colleges and after 8 years of jobs, now it hardly matters who came from IIT Bombay or Kharagpur or who came from LPU or VTU colleges. In fact, I have seen the other way around. One of my friend didn't get in very good college so he put an extra effort in off-campus and gave more than 15 interviews in a row. He didn't confine himself to the on-campus opportunities and this I am talking about 2011-12, now things have become much better. Yes, he started at lower ctc but his determination and hard work paid off - he learned whatever he worked on in-depth (believe me most of us in the IT industry just completes our works NOT really go in-depth of the things and understand it in and out). He switched to another company and the next switch was a big e-commerce company and his ctc was well above 20 in the first 3 years. I have various similar examples recently someone switched from ctc of 8 to 30+ in Walmart (he also doesn't come from tier-1 college). Anyway, the bottom line is you have to put in extra effort and have patience. 

Spend time working towards your goal rather than crying over what you don't have or didn't have. And if you really feel you are at disadvantage then pickup google and search or maybe just look around yourself. You will find so many people who are in much much much worse condition than yourself but still, they are not making those things stop them. I have so many examples but won't bore with those stories, maybe in some blog I can put all these to motivate people because people like actual anecdotes. 

And many people ask me or here also are asking - not from tech background what to do? Whoever reached out to me, I have answered them in detail as per their profile or given some references who have made similar transitions. Wil briefly mention it here else this comment will become an article! :P 
Non tech background comes in two categories:
1> Engineering but not CS/IT
2> Non-engineers BA,Commerce etc.

See, above is degree wise category. But what I prefer is a knowledge-wise categorization (for preparation):
1>You know about data science and software engineering. For example one of my cousins - was in minings but he did a side project in Java. So, even though he was not from tech background he had a fair understanding of tech and had a knack for programming.
2> You have no clue about data science but have done some small crash course in some programming language or you know some basics about coding. Mech or Civil guy who just studies 'C' in the first sem but never opened it again. Or some commerce student (one of my friend she did a course in NIIT in Java - yes when I was in college Java was a kind of defacto language to learn) but then didn't practice much and became an accountant.
3> You have no clue about the software industry, tech, programming language, etc. 

Why I categorize people ethis way because it help me to suggest a feasible plan for them. I was recently talking to a girl from non-tech background falling in third category. Now, it will be unrealistic if I suggest to her that in 6 months she can be ready for a data science interview. 
One thing I forgot - my first question to all these people especially someone who has no clue about software, DS etc.  is ""WHY?"". THE WHY is very important - why you want to transition to DS. This why tells you how much effort and passion that person has for making the shift. Many of the people reply to me 'because it's a hot job nowadays and getting paid handsomely' - it is okay if you want to make a switch for money but do you really like whatever you know about DS and if you don't about DS then why do you want to make switch? Because like any other field - it requires dedication to excel and if you don't excel then you won't be getting that high pay for which you switched in the first place - you will get a job and will be doing good (even if you don't excel excel in it). If you have a strong 'why' then it becomes easy to stick to the plan.

Post these things - decide a timeline. Let's say 1 year. then plan to finish the syllabus by 9 months and keep the last 3 months for revising and interview prep. I have seen many people good with tech but not prepared for an interview  - they get nervous or  not able to explain in clear and concise manner or having a language barrier. And then many don't come prepared for the company - when you go for an interview even if it's just a developer role - read about that company. When asked the question do you know this company then don't just say not really - I have got that answer many times. Then it gives an impression you didn't even put an effort into knowing about the company where you are going to work then how much effort you will put in the job! So spend last 3 months searching , applying and practicing. 
Prior to that breakdown the whole syllabus into smaller milestones. Le's say Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning etc. Then further break it down. And keep something which you can achieve in 2 weeks. LEt's say you plan 2 weeks for regression - then keep 30-40% in theory and rest of the time spend in implementing what you learnt. MAke sure to add in GitHub and share on social media - LinkedIn etc. And there are various blog sites - you can write down what you learned. Benefit of this? One of my professor told me once - if you want to know if you have understood something try teaching that to someone who doesn't know it or to a kid and if you are able to explain it to them then that means you have really understood it. So if you write a blog - while writing only you will know your weak points and post that once published many people will read it and they can point out the mistakes too. Don't be afraid of making mistakes - one who makes mistakes can only correct it. One who never wrote it or tried it can never correct it. 
Why have 2 weeks goal because that way you can track your progress quickly - if you are off the track within 2 weeks you will know and can work to fix it. If you keep big milestones such as in 3 months I will finish 'X' syllabus then only after 3 months you will have time to fix it and also, you will get a little laid back thinking you have 3 months to complete. 

While doing all this make sure to network. Reach out to people from DS field and talk to them, and also connect with people who are making a transition similar to you. Networking helps you a lot - it's known and shared at many places - about 2/3 of jobs comes via referrals,connections etc. they are not put out in Naukri kind of job portal (straight away). And spend some time in preparing the syllabus for your plan don't just put the stuffs which are fancy but not much used in all the DS jobs for example GANs - very good and I love them but majority of DS jobs at least when you are starting doesn't require knowledge of GAN. So when you have limited time focus on the important topics not just fancy ones!

If you follow your plan then you can for sure achieve your goal. Just make a feasible plan and stick to it.

Also having knowledge of multiple domains is easy but ideally you can't be expert at all, may be end with expertise in non.  But if you are in one domain even you put less effort you will acquire vast knowledge. And obviously can become expert if worked properly.

"Krish is very thorough when it comes to explaining a DS topic. And Abhishek is absolutely The Grandmaster. Theory regarding any topic (even if it is sparsely related to DataScience) is important. Cause the depth in theory allows critical thinking, but that said there is something which is far more important. It is called Intuition. Intuition is the biggest gap any strong AI will absolutely wish to reach.
Intuition allows you to decide which way to proceed even when you barely know anything about the topic (example: think about what would you do if you see a snake in the middle of the road).
What I am really excited about is this book by Abhishek. I have been closely following him for a long time now. And I think this book will definitely help a lot of budding Data Scientists to fine tune their hyperparameter called Intuition.
I would love to read a copy of this book. Let me know where to sign up.",0.183823529

"People may jump at me but I have two major concerns/queries with this app.

The first thing I am wondering is more on the business side of it  -  there are many use cases of AI where the privacy concerns are so high that it never comes to market. In this case when I am writing a code that means it's being read by some AI model (though GitHub has given a Lil bit of confusing statement denying it). I am not sure how many companies will be okay to share their codes with a third party!!! I know people will say we already have repos in git and all but still this is a bit different.

Second thing - Honestly, I am not a fan of this kind of app being used by college students. Don't mistake me, I am very much in support of tech n growth and all new things - it will have pros and cons, I do get it. 
But I feel this is handy for people in the job - where the main task is to solve the business case not to show your expertise in programming. So, there it saves time - I have logic to solve the use case but instead of writing codes for merging array or sorting (just an example), I can use this. 

But for a college student, it's important to write code on their own obviously after understanding it. We have seen many people just mugging up the code and writing in exams and when a single variable is missed or one bracket is misplaced the code fails and they can't fix it because they had just mugged up the code. In this scenario, if a student uses this then I am not sure how he/she will do in a lab exam. I am okay, if a student understands all the codes coming in automatically then uses it but we all know what will happen.
The whole practice of writing code is to build up your logical skills - that's why when I take interviews of any freshers or for that matter anyone, I focus more on the pseudo-code and system design, not the actual code. Yes, obviously a minimum level of knowledge is required for the language too.",0.191386724

"Hi Krish, greetings from Chile! I have a question, the first layer (Input Layer) I noticed that you use an activation function to the inputs. Is it OK to do that? I imagine it as a transform to your inputs doing a Relu and then that info you pass to the next layer, but you loss all inputs that are less than zero since with the StandarScaler transformation you would transform  certain data and obtain data with negative values.
It not will better just apply Dense (with no activation) on the Input Layer?",0.194047619

"It's overhyped to an extent and institutes are fooling us to make money. 
Having said that AI/data science is filled with buzzwords which requires foundation l maths only  . So you don't actually need to do a course in DS. 

By calling themselves Data scientists, people are running packages which can be done by anybody. 

So I don't really feel it's a skill. Some jobs are there but there isn't excess.The only real skill is data analysis which has been there in the industry for ages. Yes, companies do fool clients by using the term AI.",0.2

"Thanks Krish, you are the best!. A question related to the ""second session"" about the Product_Category_(1,2,3), I understand that you explain that in case of NaN values in categorical feature you can use the Mode to replace the NaN values. But for this particular case I think that  is important to understand the data before doing that, since Product_Category_(1,2,3) indicated that the products can be part of multiples categories. For example a movie being categorized as ""Drama, Action, Suspense"". So for this case maybe it would be better  to try to use dummies for Product_Category_(1,2,3) and then try to sum it, it would be complex to implement it but you would get the real information about your data, since you can get the info about Product_1 being a (0,1,0,0,1,0,1) if that product has 3 categories.

Thats true..

"Maybe for initial 1 year or so still understandable, but other than that WFH is still the better option as per me. And getting help from team mates and learning is totally dependent on individual and their team mates. My team mates are super helpful I can call them or stay in a call and unmute for a few seconds to see or know something new and simply done.. Also not to mention the travelling time and all other chores before and after office they easily take up 3 to 4 hrs every day, if I can save that time I would even be happy to work for 1 hr extra hour everyday if needed.. And speaking of saving some money, in India at least, freshers are paid such low salary so often that it comes down to sustaining at the place let alone saving.. And no ""taking a nap in the afternoon"" is not really something everyone does, but even if so, if someone is still delivering the desired outcomes, I don't see a problem with that.. If someone is happy he or she will definitely be more productive.. I guess in this discussion here we have to agree to disagree.. Giving individual option is the best solution according to me.. Thanks again for the content you are providing, your videos are very inspiring..",0.20966811

"Starting an internship program is great Krish and Thank you very much for doing it!!! But In a company, if anyone is fresher or before starting any project, they get trained on how to get started and proceed with projects and execute the same because doing this kind of project in this internship might be easier for the people who have some industry experience but as a fresher or beginner who is just learning the skills or has learned, doing this kind of project will be a hard challenge and one may do not have any idea how to get even started because there is so much to do in this internship and half of the things people like me beginners might not have even heard it.

"I understand that the Agile might be used by many companies for implementing DS projects. But this only works when you have something tangible to implement. As a larger part of a DS project might be experimenting with different methodologies it becomes difficult to estimate timeline for a task. In order to deal with this issue during experimentation phase we can take a hybrid approach between Kanban and Agile. So how this would work is during the experimentation phase we plan using Kanban and when we have something tangible to implement and deploy, we switch to Agile framework.",0.214285714

"Thank you Krish Naik for this video series that will help me in my research, it's a good job ;)
04:24 Given that we can rerun the model training several times and keep the updates in order to increase the accuracy of the model, if we manage to reach an accuracy around 90% just by rerunning the model training several times in a row, given that it will keep the updates and start the new training from the previous accuracies, does this amount to training the model over more epochs?

"I was experiencing so many crunches in my career, recently we lost all the projects in my company for my technology. I was experiencing the bumpy ride and then when I decided to switch or make a transition to the data science. Honestly, I thought it will be a piece of cake I will cover it in few weeks but it was already 3 months and I was in a huge mess.I started working with kaggle too few days back and was trying to solve few of them I was really amazed there is soo much yet to learn meanwhile I was in mid of some hackathon too in my company only and when I was like I need to learn something fruitful and good yielding algos and tricks. Last week my friend suggest me to watch Krish Naik videos for Random forest as I was experiencing some difficulties. I immediately started watching and in no time I was watching all the other algorithms as well. The videos are the really amazing guiding path, I feel much more confident now I recently watched the interview tips video and I guess I am going to follow the same path . Thank you for the tips and that boosting, hope my accuracy also improves with very fewer outliers in my input :) - nashrababar111@gmail.com",0.228571429

"To everyone here you need to understand  that Instructor led are not really good. I dont want to quote a platform but I have used it personally and they read out the set slides given to them I might better as well use ""Read out load"" option from Adobe. They are instrucor led and have used it and its really bad. They want to finish off the course as fast as possible. Its really not good. And pre recorded are good because you can increase the speed of videos . 
I watch videos at 1.5x speed and trust me you should try learning videos at fast pace which you can find in pre recorded videos. 

What happens when you watch the videos at 1.5x is you will be totally attentive to what they are saying and it gets rid of pauses they take between speech. Try out it might help you.

I am not saying it will work for all but try it out. 

I am sure  Krish will agree with this method of learning. Learning with pre recorded will help you be more attentive and not worry about pace at which Instructors try to teach you because some teachers are slow speaking and some are high so you can regulate that in Pre recorded and not in Live instructor led.",0.239757576

I am spending most of my time acquiring, cleaning, processing data and making EDA, rather than implementing ML predictions etc.. 😊 Sometines, (as one of my friend says) a well done EDA makes a client happier than applying a ML prediction model just for the sake of doing it.

"Writing code is not only solving a problem, but also self-study and investment in yourself. In the process of writing code, you learn and develop.

I especially don't understand the argument that this frees people from reading the documentation. It may be liberating, but in many ways it leads to writing code that you don't fully understand. Who needs such a code?

"Really enjoying these collaborative videos. You guys along with ken are doing really amazing job of building the online data science community. Which was desperately needed(we all are fed up of cat videos and tiktok). About three months ago I never heard about any of you but now this whole data science online community feels like a family. These videos have really helped me turn my life around and I am trying my best to land my first job in data science. I know it won't be easy but as abhishek said ""with perseverance and hard work we can achieve anything"". This book will really help me in my path towards being a data scientist. It would be an honour to even be considered for it. That said decision is up to you.

If we can go on to build model though multicollinearity  is present in the data then what is the need to handle it?
The answer is, linear models are not sensitive to multicollinearity..the metrics
(r²,rmse,or accuracy when it comes to logistic regression) is not affected by a great degree even after handling multicollinearity.. before that...what's the need to go for linear models when there are state of the art models like xg, ada, random forest?
...Model explainability... business interpretations can be made easily wrt the target variable when we use linear models..
(Not to a great extent when we use logistic regression..)..When we build a linear model with multicollinearity present in the data the coefficients which we get from the model will be misleading...when 2 features are Highly correlated their coefficient's magnitude are split and shared among them(for eg. in the place of 1 we will have a coefficient of 0.5 and 0.5 between the two variables..) ..i.e.In the real world scenario when there is a one 1 unit of change in one feature it should affect 1 unit in the target feature..but the model interprets this as 0.5 units in the target feature which is misleading information when it comes to business...Hence we should handle multicollinearity when we are building linear models...of course as mentioned heatmap and vif are used to remove these kind of features...vif is a stricter and better option if model explainability is of the higher priority...",0.264871795

"@Krsih Naik,  It is a good tool but when we look at the GitHub repo of Percptilabs,  not much activity happening and no future goals set. There are only two contributors and just 201 stars. So my advice is to think twice before depending on it too much and highly recommending it to others.
Just for the sake of comparison, Apache Airflow (Data workflow pipeline) has 20,500 stars with and around 1500 contributors. or you compare it with MLflow, etc, they all create data pipelines or data workflows.",0.265

Just watched your video on 6 certificate of data science and no job it was very knowledgeable and helpful.
I have couple of questions.
I am management( finished B.com and MBA) student never learn any coding except some basics of html. I Know the basics of Excel and pretty good at statistics related to research.
I am about to get admission in PhD in a less than month.

I am interested in data science and like to work as data scientist. So i want to know is data science is like research analyst? and does data science is like research? I am pretty interested in research.

Does data science is good for computer science student and what is the scope for the people like me. What is your suggestions!!

"Hey Krish. I wanted to give you some feedback/ideas for the way you present these in the future. You obviously have an enormous knowledge of the data science sphere and provide a good roadmap to learning it. In practice, I haven't seen jobs which uses all of the data science skillset. From my experience you could divide DS jobs into several main categories with each of these needing a portion of the skills. For example: 
1) In finance - they mostly use data scientists as analysts and focus on visualization skills. Almost no ML etc. needed. 
2) In testing/research - the skill set needed is mostly based on the stats side, A/B testing etc. 
3) In your ""model building"" roles - this is where the really cool parts of DS come in where you need ML, maybe CV, deep learning etc. 
4) ML Dev side - More of a software developer who needs to know about building models in software, maybe towards deployment on the ML Engineer side too.
For new people looking to get into it and worried about learning all of this, maybe you can divide it by ""what type of data scientist they want to be"" rather than a road map to learning everything. It would seem less overwhelming and prepare them well for the job they'll get.
Thanks for another great video!",0.27521645

"Great podcast! Thanks Krish and Abhishek for the insights about Kaggle and I am really interested to read the book, because most of the people know ML algorithms but where to use which one and how to use it is a big question faced by most of us entering this field. If person doesn't has experience in respective field it's always better to listen to the domain experts and follow there footprints. I was planning for career transition into data science since 2017 but was not able to get proper resource to look refer to learn and look into for solutions, fortunately last year I came across your channel Krish and I must say I am able to solve ML problems quite well and now planning to learn Deep learning concepts. You are really creating great content for your channel viewers and always keep it up! Thanks for all ur content.

I have been following Abhishek since I came to know he became the first 4X grandmaster in the world and I follow him on nearly every platform he exists. I really love both of your content and wish you both continue to make such cool stuff for budding data scientists like us to learn and grow.
 Please send me a free copy of this book. I am following Abhishek sir everywhere to get this book!

For example, first I was not sure if this is exactly what I am looking for, so I had to scroll through the whole thing to see what the final result was.

"This is the perfect example if you want to do something, you find out a way to do the same. And also, how it's easier to switch/transition within the company compared to doing transition and switching company at the same time.
We developed similar and many more such use cases for customers and also integrated with Salesforce, Zendesk, Zoho, Jira etc. 
But always remember, if you are not from data science and you come up with such a use case on your own and do a PoC - it always adds much more value compared to someone who is already in the DS and does this project. Why? Because it shows your curiosity, learning, and hard-working nature. And by implementing you are already demonstrating you can handle ownership. **Always try to implement - if you go in an interview or even in your company if you just pitch an idea - you may not get much traction from the people (unless and until you are CXOs or VP kinda thing). As a product manager that's how I pitch my stretch goal use cases to my CTO...do a quick PoC showing yes the idea is doable..then proper Data Engineers/scientists sit and refine it and make it a deployable product :)",0.291666667

"My favourite tip for data science interview is to be prepared as much as possibile about your projects and gently including answers for questions the interviewer could Ask. For example I used xgboost for classification for imbalanced dataset so i know they may Ask how to fight overfitting, what is oversampling, how tree based algorithms work, what is boosting and I include that cery gently in my presentation before they start asking questions. In that way I avoid the possibility of misunderstanding questions etc.

The other advice is to prepare some interesting questions about company, how teams are builded, if they are using Agile, what is data scientist responsible for, if do they have ml engineers, data engineers, analysts etc. Everytime I asked such questions I was complimented for that.",0.3

"SVM can handle balanced and imbalanced dateset with the help of 'c' parameter. c is a parameter which can be though of how much strict we want our model to be or in other words how many data-points we allow the model to make mistake in. Therefore as in a imbalanced dateset, no of points from one of the classes is already low , so we cannot afford to allow the model to make higher number of  mistakes. So we have to make the model more strict , i.e choose a higher c value.

"My favourite tip for data science interview is to be prepared as much as possibile about your projects and gently including answers for questions the interviewer could Ask. For example I used xgboost for classification for imbalanced dataset so i know they may Ask how to fight overfitting, what is oversampling, how tree based algorithms work, what is boosting and I include that cery gently in my presentation before they start asking questions. In that way I avoid the possibility of misunderstanding questions etc.

The other advice is to prepare some interesting questions about company, how teams are builded, if they are using Agile, what is data scientist responsible for, if do they have ml engineers, data engineers, analysts etc. Everytime I asked such questions I was complimented for that.",0.3

To summarize we can say the below w.r.t Student scenario:

Scenario#1: Ideal Student or Role Model Student with Conceptual learning hence ends up as a Topper!!!  --> IDEAL MODEL
Scenario#2: Bookworm or Mugging up expert who just memorizes the syllabus without really understanding the concepts --> OVERFITTING
Scenario#3: Lazy Student who does not put any effort in preparing for the Exams hence ends up getting less scores --> UNDERFITTING
Scenario#4: Paper Leakage resulting in temporary high scores but the student might end of performing badly in final exams --> DATA LEAKAGE

Thanks Krish now I will never forget the Overfitting and Underfitting concepts!!!

I am planning to buy a mac book for learning Data Science, ML and DL. My budget is 1.5K USD.
I have looked at a few of your videos regarding the laptop requirements for DS, ML and DL.
But I am purchasing the Mac Book for the m1 chip.

Could you please let me know which of the below two mac Book configurations will suit me the best:
1) Mac Book Air (M1) - 8core CPU, 8 core GPU, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD 
2) Mac Book Pro (M1) - 8core CPU, 8 core GPU, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD
3) Mac Book Pro (M1) - 8 core CPU, 8 core GPU, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD

I am interested in the second option, but am genuinely concerned if the 256 GB SSD will be sufficient enough for the DataScience, ML and DL projects.

Please help me decide.

"So here comes my most awaited session😍. The two most inspiring data scientists together enlightening the way for the students like me to the data science field. I have watch lots of videos and sessions delivered by both of you and trust me those are very much helpful to me when I initially started switching to this domain. 
There is no comparison between both of you but one thing I must that Krish sir you are doing great work. Every time, I got stuck anywhere during my learning process there is always some relatable video by you on your channel that leads me to overcome the problem I am facing. 
Post on LinkedIn from both of you is also helping a lot to me to look into the points for acquiring depth knowledge in this domain. 
I have read a few books from O'Reilly and looking forward to gaining some more applied knowledge in this field from the book by Abhishek Sir. 
I missed today's live session but I watched it later on, but as always it was a great one.
Heartiest thanks to both of you!😍 
Keep motivating and helping us.

I feel angry over myself for not learning things..and I really wanted to learn something new..please guide me I've two options, block chain or data science or do you have any other suggestions?

"The way in which you explained the basics of this concept is awesome. It created a nice flow for understanding the concept.

Also admire that you have used a circular frame for your video (similar to how HC uses it) which improves the look and feel. 

Just a suggestion- Since you've placed yourself in the bottom-right of the screen, could you kindly flip the video of your face to its mirror image? That would make it look as if you are looking towards the black-board and not in the opposite direction.

"In my first company, HP (now DXC) it was company policy to keep the good performing employees to stay stuck doing the same job and without any salary bonus or even recognition, while the managers would purposefully hamper the promotion of good employees to keep them working in the rut, while those less deserving employees who were the boss's best pals were given steady promotion and even better perks and compensation like on-site visits etc. The manager himself would ever so subtly convey that anybody who would be the best performer would get a chance to go to US. Forget about the US, the good performers were not even allowed to move out to a better project! I secretly went and gave the interview for a different and better project to get selected. Similarly, the company had this uncanny way of making its employees focus more on IJPs than on better opportunities outside. And the way that they did all of this rubbish was to promote such people to the higher position who would tow their company policy line and show off to be such high fi shots of themselves that we had to follow whatever bullcrap they had to say. You could recognise them by the way that they had am air of superiority and overconfidence about themselves. So, nowadays whenever I see an employee of DXC wearing an air of superiority or over confidence in himself, I tend to ignore and stay far away from them.",0.344666667

"Thanks for the wonderful sessions krish and abhishek. I was wondering how i can be motivated doing kaggle as like not only me i think many beginners are facing the same problem. We are doing many online courses available and we feel confident while doing the projects on that course as we go hand to hand with the instructor but still when we try to do kaggle we get stuck and lack motivation to continue on it we get stuck from where we should start. And following podcast and interviews of both you and abhishek i am not getting confidence about what kaggle can offer and how we can start. Looking forward to participate more on kaggle thank you 😊
I hope i might get the free copy of book as i think this book is what i have been looking forward as i think i have gathered many basic knowledge going through various courses but still lacks applied knowledge to uplift my career. Thank you!!!

"Sir, first of all a request from both of you. Please collaborate more and more in future. The way you guys discussed things in this video, we can get a lot of help if you can do more such videos in future.
I have been watching your tutorials for quite some time now and they have been very useful for me. The way Krish sir explain us the road map for learning things, then tutorials for all those things in separate playlists. You are amazing sir. Then, the way Abhishek Sir brings people with unique ideas and innovations and do tutorial videos together, the way he shares his experince with us is just great. Although, I amd just a beginner for now, but I really hope that someday I am in a position to contribute to this amazing community of ours just like you guys. I strongly believe thas this book of yours will be very helpful for us beginners, who know the theoretical part, but struggle to approach a problem, or to decide which algorithm to apply, how to do the feature scaling, the best practices while training a model.
I really hope to get a copy of your book Sir. And it would be much great if it can be hand signed by you. Thankyou Sir.

Love this video series. Would love to see one showing how I could deploy an ML model I have trained on Jupyter Lab in Flask. Also how to have a file upload button in the app with which the file could then be used as input to the model. I.e. The app would allow someone to upload a video which could then be used as input to my CV ML model. Thanks!,0.4

Applied is more important than theory. This is what comes to my mind when I hear Abhishek Thakur. This guy dropped out of his PhD and focused on applied machine learning. You name the competition and Abhishek has been involved either in the kernel or the discussion forums. I am super excited that he is launching his book. What can be better than learning from the expert himself. He is condensing his knowledge that he gained over the years on kaggle in his book. Looking forward to it.,0.402083333
"Nice collaboration video with kaggle grand master abhishek sir. It will be great if you make video with parul mam (working in H²O.ai) also. She recently become kaggle grandmaster in notebook section or make a nice collaboration video with both regarding their journey. A common thing between abhishek sir and parul mam is both are from electronic/electrical background and not from cs.
Some questions-
1- data science job in big company or in startup.
2- good practice to inculcate in data science journey
3- coomon mistake done by new people.

I have done btech from electrical and planned to switch in data science domain. I am currently doing summer analytic courses by iit guwahati consulting and analytics club.They actually compiles the best YouTube videos, free courses like Andrew nag course,blog, notebook. 

It will be great if you consider me for the book because it will be great help to me in my journey.

Keep making video,keep inspiring,keep growing.

"In vaccination case both FP and FN are important.

1). If vaccine really has an side effects but our model predict it hasn't, then it will leads to disaster. So, for that we need to reduce FP.

2). On other hand if vaccine doesn't have any side effects but model shows that it has. Then this results might be put a fear in people's mind and they will not go for vaccination. In this case FN become more important.

So, good model that predict whether a vaccination has any side effects or not should have reduce both FN and FP results.",0.425

"What you said about reverse engineering makes perfect sense.  😊As you said, the main reason a Google (or FB, or Microsoft) model can beat most other models is that Google has more compute power. I've heard teachers from institutions like MIT, Stanford, etc saying that their PhD students couldn't win ML or DL competitions simply because the big companies had better compute power. Of course, there are always exceptions. Better architectures can create better models. All things being equal though, more powerful computers give better accuracy. 


When you reverse engineer a very good model you get at least two benefits from that:
   1. you get in your own application the great performance of that model
   2. you understand more about ML and, who knows, you figure out ways to improve an already great model. 😊",0.447619048

But finally i have the simplest yet most effective data science learning path for everyone :- 
1) Go through all krish's tutorial. That would prepare the strongest foundation for machine learning. All the required theory along with  required mathematics can be learned from his videos.
2) For applied part , go through Abhisek's upcoming book ( who can guide better than grandmaster himself)  .
3) Apply the learning from 1) and 2) in Industry/Kaggle.

"Hi everyone.. I am requesting don't be so cheap and talk about fee reduction to 4000Rs, even if they do so,  you people will ask for 2000Rs.. its our mindset here definitely not the cost ..  you become rich by making best use of what they are providing at their best..

 if you want to earn 10 lakhs per year , can't you pay 7k for what makes you a deserving professional earning over a lakh per month.. 

Literally I felt Krish should not be wasting his valuable time (even if it is a minute) in answering such pity questions even after fixing the price at the best reasonable affordable rate to every single job aspirant..
Unknowingly you are doing more harm by demotivating the startup who want to revolutionize the education sector providing best services at very affordable price to every one , literally everyone.. hence my friendly request to you all.. they will have to hire, work and support us 24×7, so how do they manage ?

"Thank you Mr. Krish for organizing this helpful online event and Mr. Abhishek, for giving out wonderful guidance to beginners. Would definitely like to use the book for learning skills to implement Data Science and Machine Learning projects and competing well in Kaggle competitions on the lines of the guidance provided in this video. Also, the book would prove to be a very useful companion for solving Machine Learning  problems which in turn will help me in my journey to become a proficient Data Scientist and a capable Machine Learning practitioner. 

Having an extreme passion for Machine Learning and Data Science, I am very enthusiastic at the prospect of using my learning from the above, and what could be better than a learning resource coming directly from the great - author, teacher and Data Science expert - Mr. Abhishek Thakur through the medium of a devoted educator - Mr Krish Naik. 

I look forward to learn from you both, and my best wishes to both of you...

One thing i would like to add is when you train your cnn model you need to add another category of class such as other because if you upload any other pic than plant disease then its gonna classify as disease only rather than detecting it as other cause proability values adds to 1 and cnn thinks the uploaded pic only belongs to the class category it was trained on.so keep this in mind while training the model otherwise it is a great project .,0.8

"hi sir, you made a great video.
But in the Sgd with momentum equation, some error is there.

in the video, you explained this equation
w_t = w_t-1 - (learning_rate)*dw_t

dw_t = B* dw_t-1  + (1-B)*dl/dw_t-1
but in this eqaution it's sholud not be dl/dw_t-1. it will be dl/dw_t

So correct equation is
dw_t = B* dw_t-1  + (1-B)*dl/dw_t",0.8
